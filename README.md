# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a **clean Jupyter notebook** where I explore the Titanic dataset step by step using Python.  
The goal is **not modeling**, but to **practice and document the EDA process**: how to look at data, generate charts, and spot patterns.

---

## 📂 Contents
- `EDA_github_ready.ipynb` → the main notebook, structured and annotated for GitHub
- `data/` → (not included here, place Titanic CSV files inside)
- `plots/` → auto-generated charts

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Find in the Notebook
- **Univariate analysis**: histograms of numeric features, counts of categorical features  
- **Bivariate analysis**: target (`Survived`) vs. each feature (boxplots, barplots)  
- **Multivariate checks**: feature–feature comparisons to understand dependencies  
- **Missing value exploration**: which columns need imputation  
- **Outlier visualization**: spotting extreme values in `Fare`, `Age`, family counts  

---

## 🚦 Purpose
- Serve as a **reference notebook** for anyone learning how to do EDA  
- Show how to **systematically explore a dataset** using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- Create a **template workflow** I can reuse for future datasets

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone/download the repo.  
2. Place Titanic CSVs into `data/`.  
3. Open `EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.  
4. Run through cells to reproduce plots.

## ✨ Next Steps
This notebook is code-only. Explanations and a full walkthrough (why each chart matters, how to interpret them, what normalization/regularization mean, etc.) will be published as a **separate article**.  
That article can be referenced here once it’s live.
